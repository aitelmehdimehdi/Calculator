# Calculator
 I built a desktop calculator application using Java and the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT). The calculator supports essential arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and a clear function.

The interface was designed to be clean, intuitive, and responsive, allowing users to perform calculations smoothly and efficiently. This project enhanced my skills in Java GUI development, event handling, and creating practical desktop applications with a structured and user-friendly design.
